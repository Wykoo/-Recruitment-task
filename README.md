# -Recruitment-task
Recruitment task
So here is my full code of the recruitment-task.
I was having an issue with one function when you are going to suggest the user the nearest free time, so i comment it. In case if you would like you see that.
Also i have never written an Unit test and i tried one with function that cancel your resrvation. Just wanted to try it, because in the task was wrtiten that it is nice to have 
so i tried my best with this one. But i'm an fast learning person so a week or two and i would fully understand this function.
I hope that my skill set with python is enough to become an intern in Profil Software.
Best Regards,
Mateusz Wykowski
